\title{Interactively choose extent}
\usage{
interactiveExtent(polyList, cellType = "square", bb = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{polyList}{a list of Simple Feature polygons or points.}

\item{cellType}{either \code{hexagon} or \code{square}.}

\item{bb}{c(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) to limit the extent for 
the interactive plot.}
}
\value{
A list with a polygon, and its WKT string
}
\description{
Given a list of polygons or point occurrences, sets up
	an interactive plot	to allow the user to draw the desired extent. 
This can be used to	define the extent in \code{\link{createEPMgrid}}.
}
\details{
This function returns both a sf polygon and the same polygon
		as a WKT string. Either can be supplied to \code{\link{createEPMgrid}}
		as the extent. A recommended strategy is to use this function to find
		your extent, and to copy/paste the WKT string into your R script so that 
		you can retain it for future use, and maintain reproducibility. See example.

	What is chosen for \code{cellType} has no effect on what you might choose in 
	\code{\link{createEPMgrid}}. Square cells will probably be fastest. If hexagons
	are selected, grid cell points are plotted instead of polygons to speed up plotting.

	The basemap is from \url{www.naturalearthdata.com}.
