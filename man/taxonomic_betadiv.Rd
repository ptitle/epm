\title{Map turnover in species communities}
\usage{
taxonomic_betadiv(x, radius, component = "full", slow = FALSE, nThreads = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object of class \code{epmGrid}.}

\item{radius}{Radius of the moving window in map units.}

\item{component}{which component of beta diversity to use, can be \code{"turnover"}, 
\code{"nestedness"} or \code{"full"}}

\item{slow}{if TRUE, use an alternate implementation that has a lower memory footprint 
but that is likely to be much slower. Most useful for high spatial resolution.}

\item{nThreads}{number of threads for parallelization}
}
\value{
Returns a grid with mean community dissimilarity for each cell.
}
\description{
Mean taxonomic community dissimilarity is 
	calculated for each cell within a circular moving window of neighboring cells.
}
\details{
For each cell, mean dissimilarity is calculated from the focal cell to each of its neighbors.

	All metrics are based on Sorensen dissimilarity and range from 0 to 1.
	For each metric, the following components can be specified. These components are additive,
	such that the full metric = turnover + nestedness. 
	\itemize{
		\item{turnover}: species turnover without the influence of richness differences
		\item{nestedness}: species turnover due to differences in richness
		\item{full}: the combined turnover due to both differences in richness and pure turnover
	}
