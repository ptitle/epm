reduceToCommonTaxa(x)

new \code{epmGrid} object.

\description{
An EpmGrid object may contain more taxa with morphological
	data than taxa with phylogenetic information, or vice versa. This 
	function subsets all epmGrid components to the set of taxa shared 
	across geographic, phenotypic and phylogenetic datasets. This might
	desirable to ensure that all diversity metrics are based on the same 
	set of taxa.
